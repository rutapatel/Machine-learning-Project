# Machine-learning-Project
Improvement of Airbnb Montreal Project
This project was an attempt to improve the accuracy of the Airbnb Montreal project by considering more predictive variables and implementing few more machine learning algorithms such as Ridge, Bayesian Ridge, and KNN. Sentiment analysis was done to include more variables for much accurate results. Total of 18 variables were used for this analysis. 
Further, regression based analysis was converted into Classification analysis to increase the accuracy. Important features were identified through XGBoost, so that a classification model is built only using those variables that contribute the maximum. As a result, these 18 variables caused 63% of the variability in the price of the given listings. Highest accuracy of 87% and precision of 90% was achieved. Again, this project was implemented using Python and Scikit-learn. For building the models, “yellowbrick regression visualizer” was used, which is an open source python project to extend the scikit-learn API
